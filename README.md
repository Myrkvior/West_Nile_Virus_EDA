# Capstone Project â€“ Google Data Analytics
## West Nile Virus EDA, United States 2010-2020
As my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics program, I chose to design my own case study and perform an exploratory data analysis on reported West Nile virus cases within the United States for 2010-2020. 

To view the analysis:
- The rendered HTML file is included in this repository as a .zip file (due to GitHub upload size constraints), which can be opened and viewed in your local environment. 
- You may also view it in your browser as a Kaggle Notebook here: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/myrkvior/west-nile-virus-eda](https://www.kaggle.com/code/myrkvior/west-nile-virus-eda)
- Please note that the Kaggle notebook browser version has slight modifications in the HTML page formatting due to issues pertaining to the hosting platform (analysis content remains the same).

This exploratory data analysis provides an overview of reported West Nile virus cases over the past decade within the United States and attempts to address two key questions:
-	What case trends are we currently seeing for West Nile virus within the United States, and which geographic regions are most impacted by these trends?
-	Are there any correlations between identified case trends and potential environmental driving factors?

This capstone project documents the data analytics process in its entirety and showcases the skills and tools learned throughout the Google Data Analytics program using R, R Markdown, SQLite, Power Query, and Excel
