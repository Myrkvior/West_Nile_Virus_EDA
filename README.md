# Capstone Project â€“ Google Data Analytics
## West Nile Virus EDA, United States 2010-2020
As my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics program, I chose to design my own case study and perform an exploratory data analysis on reported West Nile virus cases within the United States for 2010-2020.  

This exploratory data analysis provides an overview of reported West Nile virus cases over the past decade within the United States and attempts to address two key questions:
-	What case trends are we currently seeing for West Nile virus within the United States, and which geographic regions are most impacted by these trends?
-	Are there any correlations between identified case trends and potential environmental driving factors?

The repository contains an html document of the data analysis rendered through R Markdown as well as all data files used for this analysis.  This capstone project documents the data analytics process in its entirety and showcases the skills and tools learned throughout the Google Data Analytics program using R, R Markdown, SQLite, Power Query, and Excel
