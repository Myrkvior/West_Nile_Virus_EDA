## Introduction

This exploratory data analysis centers on West Nile virus within the United States and explores case trends nationally from 2010 through 2020.  

Overview on the significance of West Nile virus:

* West Nile virus first emerged in the United States as an outbreak in New York City in 1999 before rapidly spreading and becoming endemic, with all continental states and the District of Columbia reporting at least one locally acquired human case by 2012. ^1,2^  It is now the leading cause of human arboviral disease within the contiguous United States and persists as mosquito-borne transmission cycles within bird amplifier hosts.^1^  

* Majority of human infections for West Nile virus are subclinical,  with 70-80% estimated to be asymptomatic.^1^  Individuals who are symptomatic generally experience a mild systemic, febrile response.  Less than 1% of human infections for West Nile virus progress into neuroinvasive disease, which typically presents as one or more of the following: meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis.  The risk for the development of neuroinvasive disease increases with older age, having an immunosuppressive condition, or an underlying medical condition that may facilitate viral passage through the blood-brain barrier.^3^

* There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment available for West Nile virus infection - only supportive treatment and care is provided.^4^  

Disease surveillance continues to be important for West Nile virus, with monitoring seasonal outbreaks and identifying populations at increased risk so that resources are efficiently managed for prevention and control activities.  The ability to forecast West Nile virus outbreaks remains an active area of interest as well, as it would allow for proactive interventions in geographic regions predicted to be most impacted.^1^        

One area that researchers have been currently examining for forecasting West Nile virus outbreaks are the environmental conditions, how they have been trending across various geographic regions, and their relationships against arboviral outbreak trends.^5^  Favorable environmental conditions play an important role in mosquito vector population densities, which in turn, may influence the success of transmission and spreading of West Nile virus.

**There are two key questions this analysis will be addressing:**

* **What case trends are we currently seeing for West Nile virus within the United States?**
* **For identified case trends, are there any correlations with potential environmental driving factors?**

### Goals

In this exploratory analysis, we will be looking at an overview of reported West Nile Virus cases over the past decade within the United States and seeing what trends reflect nationally.  We will identify which geographic regions are most impacted based on these trends and explore three potential environmental driving factors behind these trends: temperature, precipitation, and dew point.  

### Stakeholders

Key stakeholders for this analysis:

* General public
* Individuals and organizations involved in public health surveillance activities

## Data Preparation and Processing

### Data Sources

All data concerning reported West Nile virus cases for 2010-2020 were derived from the CDC through their publicly available Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) publications.

* **MMWR Publications:** [2010](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6030a1.htm), [2011](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6127a3.htm), [2012]( https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6225a1.htm), [2013](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6324a1.htm), [2014](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6434a1.htm), [2015](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6602a3.htm), [2016](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6701a3.htm), [2017](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6741a1.htm), [2018](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6831a1.htm), [2019](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032a1.htm), [2020](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7118a3.htm) (click on year to view URL source)

All CDC material used for this analysis are available at no charge through the CDC URL sources specified above. 

All data concerning temperature, precipitation, and dew point for 2010-2020 were derived from NOAA through their publicly available databases.

* **Temperature and Precipitation:** [U.S. Climate Divisional Database](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/statewide/time-series) (click to view URL source)
  + Field Settings
    * Parameter: "Average Temperature" or "Precipitation"
    * Time Scale: "All Months"
    * Month: "December"
    * Start Year: "2010"
    * End Year: "2020"
    * Display Base Period: (added checkmark here)
  + For base period, 1900-2000 was selected for determination of temperature and precipitation anomaly for all states except Alaska, which was set at 1925-2000.  Reliable records for temperature and precipitation began in 1925 for Alaska.

### Data Limitations

**Limitations of CDC Data:**

* All West Nile virus disease surveillance data is maintained within the ArboNET, a national arboviral surveillance system managed by the CDC and all state health departments.  This system is dependent on providers considering West Nile virus disease as a diagnosis, obtaining the laboratory test, and reporting laboratory-confirmed cases to public health authorities.  

* Neuroinvasive cases are considered a more accurate indicator of West Nile virus activity than non-neuroinvasive cases due to the severe morbidity associated.^6^  The reporting of non-neuroinvasive cases are more affected by disease awareness and the ability to obtain healthcare resources needed for confirmation as well.  Due to this, the analysis will focus on reported neuroinvasive cases for comparing West Nile virus activity across geographic regions.  

* Only data sets on reported cases by year and by state were publicly available, which will limit the level of detail for this analysis.

* Four cases of West Nile virus are missing date of illness onset for 2017 and one case of West Nile virus is missing date of illness onset for 2018, per the CDC MMWR reports for those years.  West Nile virus cases for all other years were accounted for on date of illness onset.

* One discrepancy is present for the neuroinvasive cases within the 2015 CDC MMWR report, between the total neuroinvasive cases (1455) reported by the CDC and the summation of neuroinvasive subcategories (1528) reported by the CDC.  This discrepancy was due to the double-counting of subcategory cases, and this issue was found to be limited to 2015 for the time period 2010-2020.  The 2015 CDC MMWR report stated that 91 out of 118 cases of acute flaccid paralysis also had encephalitis or meningitis.  This was likely applied into the counts for encephalitis and meningitis, which was not done for all other years for 2010-2020.  See "CDC WNV Table Merge and Data Verification" subsection of "Collection, Cleaning, and Transformation Process" for more details.  This analysis will subsequently not assess neuroinvasive subcategory comparisons.

**Limitations of NOAA Data:**

* For temperature and precipitation, data was unavailable for Hawaii and the District of Columbia within the U.S. Climate Divisional Database.  Determination of Alaska’s temperature and precipitation anomaly also differs from the remaining contiguous states, where base period was established as 1925-2000 instead of 1900-2000.  Reliable temperature and precipitation recording began in 1925 for Alaska.

### Collection, Cleaning, and Transformation Process

#### West Nile Virus (WNV) Cases

All CDC data sets were imported using Power Query on the URL sources listed within "Data Sources" section, cleaned and transformed using Power Query, and saved as Excel Workbooks by year.   The following was used as the file name format: **CDC_WNV_insert-year**.  Each Excel Workbook contains two tables, with one table showing a breakdown of key characteristics for all West Nile virus (WNV) cases that year, and the other table showing neuroinvasive West Nile virus (WNNV) cases by state for that year.  

Data sets were cleaned and transformed on Power Query as follows (click on year to expand content):

#### CDC WNV Table Merge and Data Verification

All cleaned and transformed CDC data sets were collectively merged into two data frames on RStudio, maintaining the same formatting as the two tables contained in each Excel Workbook.  Both data frames were written as .xlsx files after further cleaning and verification were completed as outlined below.

___

##### **WNV Summary Table**

+ Initializing the library packages needed, as well as merging and initial cleaning of WNV summary table.  An overview of the initial merged table was done through glimpse().

  filter(characteristic!='Female', characteristic!='Male') %>% 
  select(characteristic, wnv_total_cases, year)

glimpse(filtered_WNV_2010_2020)
```

+ Checking to see if the total observations makes sense for each characteristic, with 11 expected for 2010-2020 coverage.  `Neuroinvasive`, `Neuroinvasive-other`, and `Neuroinvasive-unspecified` need to be further examined since they don't meet the criteria based on the output results below.  

```{r}
filtered_WNV_2010_2020 %>% 
  count(characteristic, sort=TRUE)
```

+ Checking all neuroinvasive subcategories and the years they cover.  Verified that those with 11 observations covered 2010-2020 as shown by output results.

```{r}
total_observations_neuroinvasive <- filtered_WNV_2010_2020 %>%
  select(characteristic, wnv_total_cases, year) %>% 
  filter(grepl("Neuroinvasive", characteristic)) %>% 
  arrange(characteristic)

total_observations_neuroinvasive
```

+ Checking to see if the summation of neuroinvasive subcategories matches `Neuroinvasive` for 2012-2020 (`Neuroinvasive` missing as a category in 2010, 2011, 2017 source tables).

```{r}
total_neuroinvasive_reported <- filtered_WNV_2010_2020 %>%
  filter(characteristic=="Neuroinvasive") %>% 
  select(wnv_total_cases, year) %>% 
  rename(total_neuroinvasive_reported=wnv_total_cases)

neuroinvasive_subcategory_total <- filtered_WNV_2010_2020 %>%
  filter(grepl("Neuroinvasive", characteristic)) %>%
  filter(characteristic!="Neuroinvasive") %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(neuroinvasive_subcategory_total=sum(wnv_total_cases)) %>% 
  ungroup()

neuroinvasive_comparison <- merge(total_neuroinvasive_reported, neuroinvasive_subcategory_total, by="year")

neuroinvasive_comparison
```

+ There is a discrepancy on neuroinvasive cases for 2015, with the total neuroinvasive cases (1455) reported by the CDC compared against the summation of neuroinvasive categories (1528) reported by the CDC.  This discrepancy was due to the double-counting of cases.  The 2015 MMWR report states that 686 cases were reported as encephalitis and 613 cases were reported as meningitis, with 91 out of 118 cases of acute flaccid paralysis also having encephalitis or meningitis.

+ Summing the neuroinvasive cases reported by each state per the MMWR report verified the total neuroinvasive cases as 1455.  This double-counting issue was not found with all other CDC MMWR reports for the period range of 2010-2020. All other neuroinvasive subcategory totals were verified against state neuroinvasive summation totals reported. The 1455 total neuroinvasive cases for 2015 will be used going forward with this analysis.  Neuroinvasive subcategory comparison by year will not be explored in this analysis.

+ Creating a new data frame with neuroinvasive totals to use for this analysis, where neuroinvasive subcategories totals are used for 2010-2020 except for 2015. The value listed for 2015 will be replaced with 1455 as described above.

```{r, rows.print=14}
neuroinvasive_total_2010_2020 <- neuroinvasive_subcategory_total %>%
  cbind(characteristic=c("Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total", "Neuroinvasive_total")) %>% 
  rename(wnv_total_cases = neuroinvasive_subcategory_total) %>% 
  mutate(wnv_total_cases = ifelse(year==2015 & characteristic=="Neuroinvasive_total", 1455, wnv_total_cases))

neuroinvasive_total_2010_2020
```

+ Adding neuroinvasive totals data frame to the merged table and filtering out old `Neuroinvasive` category.  121 rows is expected for output merged table with 11 variables in `Characteristic` and 11 variables in `year`.

```{r}
WNV_summary_2010_2020 <- filtered_WNV_2010_2020 %>%

#### Temperature

All data sets were downloaded as .csv files and converted to Excel Workbooks as described under "Data Sources" section.  Each Excel Workbook was saved using the file name format **2010-2020_raw_data_insert-state_temp** under directory **Temperature_2010-2020**.  All raw data files were checked to ensure temperature unit was consistent as Fahrenheit for 2010-2020.  

A new Excel Workbook was generated, and all raw state data files were handled as separate new queries under Power Query for the cleaning and transformation process.  All raw data files were processed using the same steps.  See below for Power Query code of the processing steps using Alabama as an example.  

After the cleaning and transformation process was finished for all states, these queries were collectively appended as new to generate a merged table under Power Query.  This merged table was then imported into RStudio for a final cleaning using janitor package's clean_names() function.  The resulting data frame was written as an .xlsx file, **united_states_temperature_2010_2020**, which will be used for this analysis.

#### Dew Point

All tar.gz files for 2010-2020 were downloaded and unzipped using 7-Zip software to derive .csv files, as described under "Data Sources" section.  The file name format was retained for all directories unzipped (year).  Using a new Excel Workbook for each year, the corresponding directory was imported through Power Query, with all .csv files contained having their data sets combined and transformed into the .xlsx file.

The resulting table underwent cleaning and further transformation, using processing steps as outlined in the 2010 example below, and then saved under the file name format **united_states_dewpoint_insert-year** within directory **Dewpoint_2010-2020**.  Note that all dew point measurements are in Fahrenheit units per NOAA.

#### Dew Point Table Merge and Data Verification

All cleaned and transformed dew point data sets were collectively merged into a table on RStudio, maintaining the same formatting as the tables contained in each Excel Workbook.  This merged table underwent further cleaning, with data verification on the finalized merged table as outlined below.

+ Initializing the library packages needed, as well as merging and initial cleaning of the dew point table.  An overview of the initial merged table was done through glimpse().

```{r, message=FALSE, class.source='fold-show'}

library(janitor)
library(lubridate)

monthly_dewp_2010 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2010.xlsx"))

monthly_dewp_2012 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2012.xlsx"))
monthly_dewp_2013 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2013.xlsx"))
monthly_dewp_2014 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2014.xlsx"))
monthly_dewp_2015 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2015.xlsx"))
monthly_dewp_2016 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2016.xlsx"))
monthly_dewp_2017 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2017.xlsx"))
monthly_dewp_2018 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2018.xlsx"))
monthly_dewp_2019 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2019.xlsx"))
monthly_dewp_2020 <- read_excel(here("united_states_dewpoint_2020.xlsx"))

merged_dewp_2010_2020 <- bind_rows(monthly_dewp_2010, monthly_dewp_2011, monthly_dewp_2012, monthly_dewp_2013, monthly_dewp_2014, monthly_dewp_2015, monthly_dewp_2016, monthly_dewp_2017, monthly_dewp_2018, monthly_dewp_2019, monthly_dewp_2020)

cleaned_dewp_2010_2020 <- clean_names(merged_dewp_2010_2020)

glimpse(cleaned_dewp_2010_2020)
```

+ Total number of rows (10,217,584) for output merged table matches what is expected based on number of rows for the involved individual tables. 

```{r, class.source='fold-show'}

# Generating list of data frames used for the merged table.
df_list <- list(monthly_dewp_2010, monthly_dewp_2011, monthly_dewp_2012, monthly_dewp_2013, monthly_dewp_2014, monthly_dewp_2015, monthly_dewp_2016, monthly_dewp_2017, monthly_dewp_2018, monthly_dewp_2019, monthly_dewp_2020)

# Provides total number of rows per data frame.
nrows_per_df_list <- sapply(df_list, function(x) nrow(x))

nrows_per_df_list

# Summation of all rows for all data frames.
sum(nrows_per_df_list)
```

+ The `date` column was separated into `year`, `month`, and `day` columns through mutate(), and `source_name`, `dewp_attributes`, and `country` columns were filtered out from the merged table.

```{r}
recleaned_dewp_2010_2020 <- cleaned_dewp_2010_2020 %>% 
  mutate(year=year(date), month=month(date), day=day(date)) %>%
  select(station_id, station_name, state, dewp, year, month, day)

glimpse(recleaned_dewp_2010_2020)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(RSQLite)

conn <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "WNV_Analysis.db")

dbWriteTable(conn, "recleaned_dewp_2010_2020", recleaned_dewp_2010_2020, overwrite = TRUE)
```

+ Checking the minimum and maximum dew point values using SQLite.  Output results are reasonably within expectations.  Dew point values of 9999.9 are considered missing observations per NOAA.

```{sql connection=conn, class.source='fold-show'}
SELECT
  MIN(dewp) AS min_dewpoint,
  MAX(CASE WHEN dewp=9999.9 THEN NULL ELSE dewp END) AS max_dewpoint,
  SUM(CASE WHEN dewp=9999.9 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_missing_observations
FROM
  recleaned_dewp_2010_2020
```

```{sql connection=conn, class.source='fold-show'}
SELECT * FROM recleaned_dewp_2010_2020
WHERE
  dewp==-97.8 OR dewp==90
```

+ Checking for duplicate records in merged table using SQLite. 0 records returned on output.

```{sql connection=conn, class.source='fold-show'}
SELECT
  station_id,
  station_name,
  year,
  month,
  day,
  COUNT(dewp) AS number_of_observations
FROM recleaned_dewp_2010_2020
GROUP BY 
  station_id, 
  station_name,
  year,
  month,
  day
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

+ Checking for nulls in merged table using SQLite. 0 records returned on output.

```{sql connection=conn, class.source='fold-show'}
SELECT
  station_id,
  station_name,
  year,
  month,
  day,
  state,
  dewp
FROM recleaned_dewp_2010_2020
WHERE
  station_id IS NULL OR
  station_name IS NULL OR
  year IS NULL OR
  month IS NULL OR
  day IS NULL OR
  state IS NULL OR
  dewp IS NULL
```

+ Further cleaning and transformation of merged table, with determining dew point average (Fahrenheit units) by month and by year for each state.  Values of 9999.9 are excluded from the averaging process (considered as missing observations per NOAA).  

```{sql connection=conn, output.var="transformed_dewpoint_2010_2020", class.source='fold-show'}
SELECT
  state,
  month,
  year,
  AVG(dewp) AS avg_dewp_f
FROM
  (SELECT DISTINCT station_id, 
                station_name, 
                year,
                month,
                day,
                state, 
                dewp
   FROM recleaned_dewp_2010_2020
   WHERE station_id IS NOT NULL AND
         station_name IS NOT NULL AND
         year IS NOT NULL AND
         month IS NOT NULL AND
         day IS NOT NULL AND 
         state IS NOT NULL AND
         dewp IS NOT NULL AND
         dewp!=9999.9)
GROUP BY
  state,
  month,
  year
```

+ Viewing the transformed table through glimpse() shows the total number of rows (6,600) matching what is expected, with `state` having 50 variables, `month` having 12 variables, and `year` having 11 variables.

```{r}
glimpse(transformed_dewpoint_2010_2020)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dbDisconnect(conn)
```

+ State abbreviations are transformed into state full names within the `state` column, generating our final merged table.

```{r}
united_states_dewpoint_2010_2020 <- transformed_dewpoint_2010_2020 %>%
  mutate(state = case_when(state=="AL"~"Alabama", state=="AK"~"Alaska", state=="AZ"~"Arizona", state=="AR"~"Arkansas", state=="CA"~"California", state=="CO"~"Colorado", state=="CT"~"Connecticut", state=="DE"~"Delaware", state=="FL"~"Florida", state=="GA"~"Georgia", state=="HI"~"Hawaii", state=="ID"~"Idaho", state=="IL"~"Illinois", state=="IN"~"Indiana", state=="IA"~"Iowa", state=="KS"~"Kansas", state=="KY"~"Kentucky", state=="LA"~"Louisiana", state=="ME"~"Maine", state=="MD"~"Maryland", state=="MA"~"Massachusetts", state=="MI"~"Michigan", state=="MN"~"Minnesota", state=="MS"~"Mississippi", state=="MO"~"Missouri", state=="MT"~"Montana", state=="NE"~"Nebraska", state=="NV"~"Nevada", state=="NH"~"New Hampshire", state=="NJ"~"New Jersey", state=="NM"~"New Mexico", state=="NY"~"New York", state=="NC"~"North Carolina", state=="ND"~"North Dakota", state=="OH"~"Ohio", state=="OK"~"Oklahoma", state=="OR"~"Oregon", state=="PA"~"Pennsylvania", state=="RI"~"Rhode Island", state=="SC"~"South Carolina", state=="SD"~"South Dakota", state=="TN"~"Tennessee", state=="TX"~"Texas", state=="UT"~"Utah", state=="VT"~"Vermont", state=="VA"~"Virginia", state=="WA"~"Washington", state=="WV"~"West Virginia", state=="WI"~"Wisconsin", state=="WY"~"Wyoming"))

glimpse(united_states_dewpoint_2010_2020)
```

+ The number of observations (132) for each state match what is expected, with `year` having 11 variables and `month` having 12 variables.  There are only 50 variables for `state` as well (not including District of Columbia).

```{r}
state_check <- united_states_dewpoint_2010_2020 %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ungroup()

California and Texas collectively experienced the greatest distributions for WNV neuroinvasive cases within the United States from 2010-2020.  During this time period, the yearly median for California was 237 neuroinvasive cases (interquartile range (IQR): 150-368 cases), and the yearly median for Texas was 108 neuroinvasive cases (IQR: 82-224 cases).  Illinois (median=51 cases, IQR: 36-92 cases), Arizona (median=67 cases, IQR: 50-92 cases), and Colorado (median=52 cases, IQR: 28-58 cases) follow, but to a significantly lesser extent with neuroinvasive case distributions and subsequent disease burden.

North Dakota and South Dakota collectively experienced the greatest distributions for WNV neuroinvasive rates within the United States from 2010-2020, likely due to smaller population density pockets coupled with more favorable WNV spreading conditions.  During this time period, the yearly rate median for North Dakota was 1.62 neuroinvasive cases per 100,000 population (interquartile range (IQR): 0.29-4.37), and the yearly rate median for South Dakota was 1.41 neuroinvasive cases per 100,000 population (IQR: 0.80-4.69).  Nebraska (median=1.00 neuroinvasive cases per 100,000 population, IQR: 0.82-2.22), Mississippi (median=0.90 neuroinvasive cases per 100,000 population, IQR: 0.62-1.04), and Arizona (median=0.98 neuroinvasive cases per 100,000 population, IQR: 0.76-1.36) follow, but to a lesser extent with neuroinvasive rate distributions and subsequent disease burden.

### Exploring Potential Environmental Drivers

Three potential environmental driving factors were examined to see if there were any correlations with the observed WNV disease incidence trends: temperature anomaly, precipitation anomaly, and dew point.  These factors were further subdivided into seasonal periods that corresponded with how the CDC divided the publicly reported WNV cases: January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December.  These seasonal periods were examined for potential correlations behind the two highest WNV total case counts observed in 2012 and 2018.

Based on these charts collectively, the following environmental correlations were found for the WNV disease incidence peaks in 2012 and 2018:

* Warmer than normal October-December on the preceding year
* Warmer than normal January-March
* Warmer than normal April-June
* Drier than normal April-June for 2012
  + This may partly explain the significant difference between WNV total case counts for 2012 and 2018.  Increased drought-like conditions promote WNV transmission indirectly by creating a more favorable environment for mosquito vectors as well as increased mosquito vector-avian host interactions with a more limiting water availability.^5^

These correlations are weak however, given that 2016 reflected similar environmental patterns nationally.  The significantly wetter than normal October-December on the preceding year may partly explain the lowered WNV total case count for 2016.  This could be due to the increased precipitation causing changes in water sources that would make it less conducive for WNV transmission indirectly.^5^  

No correlations were identified between seasonal average dew points and WNV disease incidence peaks based on the charts above.

## Key Findings and Recommendations

During 2010-2020 within the United States, total WNV cases, WNV-related hospitalizations, WNV neuroinvasive cases, and WNV-related deaths collectively experienced two peaks in 2012 (total cases-5674, hospitalizations-3491, neuroinvasive cases-2873, deaths-286) and 2018 (total cases-2647, hospitalizations-1774, neuroinvasive cases-1658, deaths-167).  Total WNV cases, WNV-related hospitalizations, WNV neuroinvasive cases, and WNV-related deaths collectively experienced lowest values in 2011 (total cases-712, hospitalizations-547, neuroinvasive cases-486, deaths-43).  

The majority of reported WNV cases had illness onset occurring in July-September, accounting for 81.8%-93.1% of yearly total cases. 

The top five states with the largest yearly WNV neuroinvasive case distributions for 2010-2020 were California (median: 237 cases, IQR: 150-368 cases), Texas (median: 108 cases, IQR: 82-224 cases), Illinois (median: 51 cases, IQR: 36-92 cases), Arizona (median: 67 cases, IQR: 50-92 cases), and Colorado (median: 52 cases, IQR: 28-58 cases).  The top five states with the largest yearly WNV neuroinvasive rate distributions for 2010-2020 were North Dakota (median: 1.62 per 100,000 population, IQR: 0.29-4.37), South Dakota (median: 1.41 per 100,000 population, IQR: 0.80-4.69), Nebraska (median: 1.00 per 100,000 population, IQR: 0.82-2.22), Mississippi (median: 0.90 per 100,000 population, IQR: 0.62-1.04), and Arizona (median: 0.98 per 100,000 population, IQR: 0.76-1.36). 

Greater emphasis should be placed on these 10 states by public health authorities for WNV prevention and control activities, particularly for the months of July-September.  These 10 states represent those that are most affected by WNV disease burden, between the states that have the highest WNV case counts and the states whose population densities are at a significantly increased risk for WNV transmission.

Weak environmental correlations were found for the WNV incidence peaks in 2012 and 2018: warmer than normal October-December on the preceding year, warmer than normal January-March, warmer than normal April-June, and drier than normal April-June for 2012.

Conducting further analysis at a higher level of detail is needed for further exploring the correlations between these environmental factors and WNV disease incidence.  To better determine the strength and direction of these correlations, we need to account for significant differences in microclimates within each state. States such as California and Texas have higher variability in these microclimates and breaking down the environmental factors and the reported WNV incidence by county-level will capture these differences.  The optimal ecology for the WNV transmission cycle and the interactions between mosquito vectors and hosts is complex, with the findings from this analysis warranting the need for further examination at the county-level.
